All,

If you have not looked at the [October/November 2018](/pdf/Newsletter_Oct_Nov_2018.pdf) newsletter make sure to do so, it has a great article by Robin Brown on the history of our community garden, plus a wonderful interview with Wilsie Reese, plot 27A (written by Kathy Schwarz), who has been a gardener in the Nyack Community Garden for about 25 years and is a former garden president! Good articles by Kathy, Liz Cherry, and Renae Leeming too, about our garden this year, check it out!
