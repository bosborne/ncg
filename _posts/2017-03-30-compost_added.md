*Enhanced Soil Is Ready for Opening Day*

A few weeks ago the planting area of the Nyack Community Garden was covered by screened organically-enriched topsoil.  Then the area was rototilled so that the soil is ready for early spring plantings when the Garden’s opening on April 9.  This addition of “new” rich soil is done every 4 to 5 years to keep the soil fertile. The Garden is typically rototilled annually.
