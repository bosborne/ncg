Dear Gardener,

I’m looking forward to gardening at the Nyack Community Garden this year, and I hope you are, too.

The Executive Committee asked me to send you application materials for the Nyack Community Garden’s 2020 season. This email is a notification that the application forms will be emailed to you within the next day or two.

If you are not interested in continuing as a Nyack Community Garden member, please let me know by return email so that you will not be sent the application materials.

If you wish to continue as a member of the Nyack Community Garden and do not receive the email with application files within the next day or two, please check that emails with attachments from [nyackcommunitygarden@gmail.com](mailto:nyackcommunitygarden@gmail.com) are not treated in as spam in your email system. Let me know if the files need to be emailed to you again or if you need a copy sent by postal mail. If you are unable to print the application files, also let me know and I’ll mail a paper copy to you.

Your application for the 2020 season must be on the 2020 forms. The completed signed application form, signed acceptance of the 2020 Rules and Regulations, and a check for your plot must be sent to the Garden postmarked no later than Saturday, Feb. 22, 2020. The materials should be mailed to Nyack Community Garden, PO Box 864, Nyack, NY 10960. Additional instructions are on the forms.

For future reference, we ask that you please keep a copy of the Nyack Community Garden Calendar, a copy of your completed application, and a copy of the 2020 Rules and Regulations.

I encourage you to invite your friends who reside in the Nyack School District and are interested in gardening at the Nyack Community Garden to email [nyackcommunitygarden@gmail.com](mailto:nyackcommunitygarden@gmail.com) to request the new member application forms.

For additional information, please go to our website at [nyackcommunitygarden.info](http://nyackcommunitygarden.info/) or email us at [nyackcommunitygarden@gmail.com](mailto:nyackcommunitygarden@gmail.com).
