Dear 2016 Gardener,

I’m already looking forward to gardening at the Nyack Community Garden this year and hope you are, too.

Applications for the 2017 season are available now, please contact [nyackcommunitygarden@gmail.com](mailto:nyackcommunitygarden@gmail.com) for more information.

Plots in the Nyack Community Garden are limited.  Some returning gardeners, especially new gardeners in 2016, will be awarded half plots rather than full plots even when full plots are requested.  2016 gardeners who did not fully plant, adequately maintain their plots, or fulfill their committee work responsibilities may be awarded a ½ plot rather than a full plot, or be wait-listed.

Best,

Robin
