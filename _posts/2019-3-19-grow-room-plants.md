## Buy tomatoes and peppers at The Grow Room!

I know that Nyack gardeners like to buy plants locally, and I've learned that Lindsey at [The Grow Room](http://www.thegrowroom.com/) on [Bridge Street in the center of Nyack](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Grow+Room/@41.0915691,-73.9212437,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xa32d17d8aef2f020!8m2!3d41.0917351!4d-73.9209755) is growing tomatoes and pepper plants that we can buy in May. She told me that she'll have these varieties:
