The garden will open on Sunday March 29.

Many vegetables do well in the spring. They will not grow as quickly as in the summer months but you should be able to get good germination because of the moister soil.

You can plant transplants or sow seed for [arugula](http://www.kitchengardenseeds.com/cgi-bin/catview.cgi?_fn=Product&_category=130 "arugula"), lettuce, members of the cabbage family (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and kale), [mache](http://www.johnnyseeds.com/p-6040-vit.aspx "mache"), spinach, carrots, beets, onions, or peas. There are also many kinds of so-called [Asian greens](http://www.johnnyseeds.com/c-358-asian.aspx) that do well in cooler weather.

Here's a [Zone 7 planting calendar](/blog/zone-7-planting-calendar/).

This would also be a good time to plant a [cover crop](/blog/cover-crops/) if you are so inclined.
