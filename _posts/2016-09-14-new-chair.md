Dear Gardeners,

![Our bench, being built](/images/Bench_in_progress.jpg)

There is a wonderful new addition to our garden  --  a handmade wooden bench located near the tool shed.  It is a place for tired gardeners to rest and for gardeners to sit and enjoy conversations with friends.  All gardeners are encouraged to use and enjoy it.

Requests by gardeners for someplace to sit and inspired by the beautiful bench that new gardener Greer Griffin installed in plot 13, Marie Dilluvio, with the approval of fellow Executive Committee members, arranged to have our custom-made bench made.  The skilled craftsperson who made it is Dan Proctor, the maker of Greer’s bench.

Dan tells us the bench is made of honey locust that he cut on a friend’s land and milled in his own sawmill.  The frame is made without nails.  Dan used mortise-and-tendons with black walnut trunnels (pins).  He shaped the curved locust branches used as arms with a drawknife.  Dan reports that honey locust is more durable and stronger than cedar.

Kudos to Dan, Marie and Greer.

Nyack Community Garden Executive Committee
