Dear Gardeners,

Good news! The Nyack Farmer's Market is back, on Thursdays as usual.

If you need some tomato plants - and growers are selling out their seeds and plants right and left
nowadays - check out the Greenbush Garden stall, they have an [excellent selection](https://www.greenbushgardens.com/uploads/7/1/2/0/71207291/seedling_list_2020_.pdf).

I got these plants, they will all do very well in our garden:

* Green Giant
* Sun Gold
* Gold Medal
* Rutgers
* Cherokee Purple
* Black Krim

Other garden favorites include Mortgage Lifter, Paul Robeson, Brandywine, Roma, San Marzano, these are all good choices. Plus peppers, lettuce, cabbage, flowers, herbs ....
