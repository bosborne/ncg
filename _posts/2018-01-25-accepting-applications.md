Dear 2017 Gardener,

Iâ€™m already looking forward to gardening at the Nyack Community Garden this year and hope you are, too.

Applications for the 2018 season are available now, please contact [nyackcommunitygarden@gmail.com](mailto:nyackcommunitygarden@gmail.com) for more information.

If you wish to continue as a member of the Nyack Community Garden and do not receive the email with application files this coming weekend, please check that emails with attachments from nyackcommunitygarden@gmail.com are not treated in your inbox as spam. This might be accomplished by adding our email address to your address book.  Let me know if the files need to be emailed to you again or if you need a copy sent by postal mail. If you are unable to print the application files, please let me know and a paper copy will be mailed to you.

Your application for the 2018 season must be on the 2018 forms. The completed application with 1) completed and signed application, 2) signed acceptance of the 2018 Rules & Regulations, and 3) check for plot must be postmarked no later than Friday, Feb. 23, 2018. Mail the application materials to Nyack Community Garden, PO Box 864, Nyack, NY 10960. Additional instructions are on the forms.

For future reference, please keep a copy Nyack Community Garden calendar and a copy of your completed application, especially the 2018 Rules & Regulations.

I encourage you to invite your friends who reside in the Nyack School District and are interested in gardening at the Nyack Community Garden to email nyackcommunitygarden@gmail.com to request application information for new members.

Best,

Robin
