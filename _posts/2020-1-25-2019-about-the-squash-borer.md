Dear Gardeners,

There's a [new rule](/garden-rules/) this year which says:

<b>All types of squash, zucchini, watermelon, pumpkin and cucumber are NOT permitted to be planted 
in plots due to an invasive pest that spreads from plant to plant.</b>

So, simple rule, don't plant anything that can harbor the squash borer, but why? 
First off, read up on this insect, here's a 
[good page describing it](https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/squash-vine-borers).
Check out the life cycle details, and the various methods to protect plants from the borer. 

OK, but what about the squash borer in our garden? Strange but true, but there are gardeners
who are not aware that the squash borer is well-established in our garden, and it's been here
for as long as many of our long-time gardeners have been here. Every year we've observed our plants,
waiting for those weeks in late July when the borer damage appears, and the plants collapse and die,
usually very quickly, sometimes overnight. In 2019, for example, I planted 2 different varieties
of summer squash 
(2 [Pantheon](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/vegetables/squash/pantheon-f1-zucchini-squash-seed-3559.html),
and 1 [Black Beauty](https://www.seedsavers.org/black-beauty-zucchini-organic-squash)) and all 3 plants
were killed by the end of July.

Some gardeners will say "But I grew summer squash last year!" That's right! A handful of plants survive
every year, sometimes very weakened, but sometimes doing pretty well. But if you observe our garden
every year over the years like we've been doing you'd conclude that somewhere around 3 out of 4 plants are killed each year,
and the larvae leave the dead plant, burrow down, pupate, and wait in the soil for the warm weather of the following year,
when they emerge as adults to mate and lay eggs on the plant stems.

Back to the treatment methods, and the real world of our garden. Pesticides are out, many gardeners in
our garden would absolutely refuse to use them. Plus this would involve spraying all plants in 
the garden every week for multiple weeks. This won't happen. What about row covers? I tried this myself a few years ago,
it did not work, presumably because the borer was in the soil right where I'd planted. As the article says:

*...because squash vine borers spend the winter in the soil near their host plants. 
When the adults emerge the following summer, they may be trapped under the row cover instead of being kept out.*

There are also other methods discussed on other pages online, diatomaceous earth, coffee grounds, wrapping stems
in foil, etc. For every one of these methods there's a person who says "did not work for me", these methods
are partially effective, at best. I tried the diatomaceous earth one season, it did nothing.

What is the most effective method, without using pesticides? From the article:

*Practice rotation to minimize this issue by planting cucurbits in different areas of your garden (if possible) 
or alternate seasons when you grow cucurbits.*

This method works, this is what an organic farmer would do. For example, they might have 2 separate fields, and plant
summer squash in one of them in alternate years.

So what will happen in <b>our</b> garden this year because of this new rule is that the borer adults will emerge in 
late spring, they will look for squash plants or other cucurbits, they won't find any plants to lay eggs on, there will be no larva growing, and
no larva overwintering. Then next year, in 2021, there will be no squash borers in our garden,
and <b>everyone will be able to grow fantastic summer squash, for the first time in many years</b>.
