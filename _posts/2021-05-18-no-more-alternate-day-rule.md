Greetings Fellow Gardeners.

We are so happy to send this email with the news that so many of you have asked for: effective immediately, we are revoking the every-other-day rule!!

We are doing so based on the recent CDC recommendation (which has been adapted by NY State) that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks in most situations and with the growing evidence that infections outdoors are rare.  So, we are revoking the every-other-day rule and retaining other common sense rules: if you are not vaccinated or are unable to maintain a six-foot distance from your fellow gardeners, wear a mask.

We hope to see all of you during this planting season!

And... One other reminder..
All plots must be fully planted by May 31 or they will be assigned to someone on the wait list.
