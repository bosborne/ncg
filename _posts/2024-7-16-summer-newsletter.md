Check out our [Summer 2024 newsletter](/pdf/Newsletter_Summer_2024.pdf), the "Commmunity"
issue. We have a great article on Rona, who was one of our youngest gardeners, and how the garden
has helped her family, and the garden as a "great place to learn about community". We also read about the garden
as a "sharing community", our pollinator gardens, and our contributions to the broader community
through Plant-a-Row. Finally we have some very interesting and useful articles about
"We Need to Change our Food System and What We Eat", the "Passion Flower" and "Chamomile", and
"Cultivating Healthy Soil".
