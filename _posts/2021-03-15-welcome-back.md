Welcome back to returning gardeners, and a big welcome to our new gardeners!
We look forward to sharing our love of gardening with you and the promising season ahead.
 
Please see two important documents: [plot assignments](/pdf/2021 NCG Plot Assignments.pdf) and [committee assignments](/pdf/2021 NCG Committee Assignments.pdf). Also see the [document about NCG going organic](/pdf/Nyack Community Garden Goes Organic.pdf). Please read it carefully also.
 
Important Reminders

* Due to the pandemic, our annual Garden meeting has been canceled, and COVID-related restrictions will remain in effect until further notice.
* Gardeners are only permitted to come in the Garden on their assigned day (see [plot assignment document](/pdf/2021 NCG Plot Assignments.pdf)). Plots highlighted in yellow can be attended on even-numbered days of the month; these plots have a red ribbon tied to the fence by their plot numbers. Plots not highlighted can only be attended to on odd-numbered days.
* Gardeners must wear face coverings when in the Garden and maintain at least a 6-foot distance from other gardeners.
 
It is critical that we adhere to these restrictions again this season in order to guarantee the health and comfort of all gardeners. As with all of our rules and regulations, not adhering to the COVID restrictions during the gardening season will result in a reduction of plot size or loss of membership. Please remember these changes were made to protect our gardeners during these uncertain times.
