Dear Gardeners,

The Garden will open on Saturday, April 18! We are delighted to be able to open the Garden at this time, but we recognize that if we do not adhere to the restrictions mandated by the state, this oasis can be taken away from us at any time.
In order to enforce social distancing we are assigning alternating days for gardeners to be in their plots. A schedule is shown below.

People *WITH HIGHLIGHTED* names may garden on *ODD* days of the month. These plots and half-plots will have a red ribbon tied to the fence, near the plot number.

People without highlighted names may garden on even days of the month (plots with no ribbon).

Other COVID19 rules:

* Only one person may be in a plot at a time (or two if you live in the same household).
* Maintain at least a six-foot distance between you and other gardeners at all times.
* Wear gloves at all times in the Garden. We also recommend a mask, in compliance with state guidelines.
* Bring your own tools, if you can.
* Disinfect any communal tools that you use, as well as the spigots, hoses, gate and lock. (Yes, spigots and hoses. Water will be on.)
* Do not leave brown compost bags by the shed or gate. If full, bring them to the curb. If not, keep them in your plot.

Finally, non-COVID19 rules and news:

The locks will not be changed, so returning gardeners should retain their keys from last season. New gardeners can pick up their keys from Pickwick Book Store. Please call ahead to be sure Jack is available: 845-358-9126.

*Remember, all types of squash, zucchini, watermelon, pumpkins and cucumbers are NOT permitted to be planted in plots this season due to an invasive pest that winters underground and spreads from plant to plant*

Once again, we recognize that these rules are restrictive. But the safety of our gardeners is our top concern.
If you are not willing to abide by these rules or are uncomfortable being in the Garden at this time, you are welcome to take this season off and return next year. Please let us know as soon as possible if this is the case.

As in previous years, all plots must be planted by May 31.
