Dear Gardeners,

Due to COVID-19, The garden opening will will be DELAYED UNTIL SATURDAY, APRIL 18. 

Also due to COVID-19 we must implement some VERY IMPORTANT new rules.

IF SOCIAL DISTANCING IS NOT OBSERVED, THE VILLAGE HAS THE RIGHT TO SHUT US DOWN!

Note: The water will not be turned on at this time. Now, the rules.

* If you or someone in your home does not feel well, do not come to the garden. Period. 
* Bring your own disinfecting wipes and disinfect the gate, lock, and any other surface you come in contact with.
* We are assigning days that you can and cannot come to the garden to enforce social distancing. Schedule is below: People whose name is highlighted may garden on odd days of the month only. Others may garden only on even days.
* If you share a plot with someone, you must coordinate and garden at different times.
* We strongly recommend that you bring your own tools
* If you cannot, the shed will be open
* The garden will not be providing any disinfecting products
* You MUST DISINFECT ALL TOOLS before and after use. You cannot assume that the person using the tools before you has done the same. This is for your own safety and the safety of your fellow gardeners.
* We recognize that these rules are restrictive. But the safety of our garden community is our top concern. If you are not willing to abide by these rules, you are welcome to take this season off and return next year. Please let us know if this is the case.
