A week or so ago we held a garden class where we planted the [Elegance Greens Mix](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/vegetables/greens/greens-mixes/elegance-greens-mix-vegetable-seed-653.html) from Johnny's. This mix is mostly different *mustard* varieties (*Brassica* species) that grow fast and like cool weather, perfect for spring and fall.
Most of what people call *Asian greens* are different *mustard* species, so this mix has those greens, plus a few
leafy cabbages. You can sow the seed very densely and then harvest the greens using your scissors, you might get
3-5 harvests from one planting. Eat the flowers as well, they're delicous.

The key to getting good germination is keeping your soil moist for the first few days and making sure your seeds have good contact with the soil. A good trick is to put a fine layer of some soil mix on top of the garden soil, then make
your shallow row, 1/4" say, in that fine soil. Sprinkle the seed in the row, cover with fine soil, and tamp that
down. Water each day, unless it's raining, and you'll get good germination.

We also talked about hoes. There are many different kinds of hoes, some for digging, some for weeding, some for
mixing. We have two kinds of weeding hoes in our shed. One is called a *stirrup hoe* or *shuffle hoe*:

This one cuts the weeds at the soil surface, using a back-and-forth motion, thus *shuffle hoe*. You can weed an
entire plot very quickly with this hoe.

The second one is called a *goose neck hoe* or *half moon hoe*:

This one is great for *fine* weeding, like in and around big plants. You cut the weeds at the soil surface
by pulling it towards you.

Use the right tool for the job!
