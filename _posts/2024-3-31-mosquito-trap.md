Here's an interesting post from the Audobon Society of Virginia that a gardener shared with me:

[HOW TO SET UP A MOSQUITO LARVA TRAP](https://www.audubonva.org/news/how-to-set-up-a-mosquito-larva-trap)

The idea is to get the female mosquito to lay her eggs in a tempting bucket of water
that has fermenting hay in it, apparently a very attractive environment for a mosquito.
Unfortunately for the mosquito the water is laced with *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt), which
kills the larvae when they hatch.

Makes you wonder if similar strategies would work with any of the pests that do the most damage
in our garden, which include the flea beetle and the squash borer (and to a lesser extent, the
bean beetle and grasshoppers). In fact, there are [squash borer traps](https://www.arbico-organics.com/product/squash-vine-borer-trap-lure/squash-vine-borers), but we've never tried them out.

Anyone want to buy some and see if they work?
