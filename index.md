## Your Community Garden

The Nyack Community Garden is a community-based, non-profit organization
that provides residents of the Nyack School District with an opportunity
to grow vegetables and flowers in a friendly environment. Using land
provided by the [Robert Martin Company](http://robertmartincompany.com)
in downtown Nyack, the garden donates surplus vegetables to local
charities and enhances the beauty of the community.

The Nyack Community Garden on [South Franklin Street between Depew and
Hudson
Avenues](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?minlon=-73.9218139648438&minlat=41.0889358520508&maxlon=-73.9215545654297&maxlat=41.0897102355957)
in Nyack is a place for community residents to garden together. The gardenâ€™s members plant vegetables,
fruits, and flowers in their individual plots and help maintain the
whole garden including surrounding flower beds. They produce nutritious
food and beautiful flowers for their own use. Many donate to local soup
kitchens and food banks through the garden.

The vital support of the [Robert Martin
Company](http://robertmartincompany.com), in concert with the Community
Housing Management Corporation, is greatly appreciated.
