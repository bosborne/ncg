## Garden Rules

1. Garden membership is at the discretion of the Nyack Community Garden’s Executive Committee.

2. The general meeting usually held in March has been canceled.

3. One 1⁄2 plot or full plot is allowed per household.

4. All Garden plots must be fully planted by May 31, 2021 or the plot will be re-assigned.

5. No gardener may transfer his/her plot to another person without permission of the NCG Board.

6. Every gardener must participate in at least one Nyack Community Garden committee and
contribute at least six hours of work.

7. Children under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult.

8. Gates must be locked at all times.

9. Visit other gardeners’ plots only when invited.

10. Maintaining your plot is a requirement throughout the entire season. If for any reason you are
unable to maintain your plot, please inform a Board member. Other gardeners may be able to
help.

11. Every gardener is responsible for keeping his/her plot and the path in front of his/her plot free of
weeds. Your weeds rapidly become your neighbors’ weeds, and that’s not OK.

12. Every gardener is responsible for keeping the fence adjacent to his/her plot clear of vines and all
climbing plants.

13. After use, return tools to the shed in clean condition. Gardeners must supply their own hand tools.

14. Sunflowers, corn, tall plants, and non-permeable ground cover are not permitted in plots and will
be removed.

15. Bag all plant waste materials in brown compost bags and take them to the Depew Ave. curb. Other
non-plant trash should be placed in black garbage bags and taken to the curb when filled.

16. Put unwanted rocks adjacent to the fence in your plot.

17. The Garden closing date is Nov. 7, 2021 at which point all plots must be cleared to look just as they
did when the Garden opened in April. Plant supports and cages must be removed from the Garden.
They may not be left by the shed.

18. The Nyack Community Garden is not responsible for your plants and other personal items.

<b><i>Failure to meet any of these responsibilities at any time during the gardening season
may result in the loss of Garden membership or other penalties.</i></b>
