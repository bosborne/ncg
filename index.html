<h2>Your Community Garden</h2>
<p>
The Nyack Community Garden is a community based, non-profit organization that provides residents of the Nyack School District with an opportunity to grow vegetables and flowers in a friendly environment. Using land provided by the Robert Martin Company in downtown Nyack, the garden donates surplus vegetables to local charities and enhances the beauty of the community.

The Nyack Community Garden is a space on <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?minlon=-73.9218139648438&minlat=41.0889358520508&maxlon=-73.9215545654297&maxlat=41.0897102355957">South Franklin Street between Depew and Hudson Avenues</a> in Nyack for community residents to garden together – to work individually and collaboratively. The garden’s members plant vegetables, fruits, and flowers in their individual plots and help maintain the whole garden including surrounding flower beds. They produce nutritious food and beautiful flowers for their own use. Many donate to local soup kitchens and food banks through the garden.

The vital support of the Robert Martin Company, in concert with the Community Housing Management Corporation, is greatly appreciated.
