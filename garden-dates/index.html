<h2>Garden Dates</h2>

<p>
<i><b>February 27</b> is the application deadline.</i>

New gardeners are encouraged to mail in completed applications as soon as possible as priority on the waiting list for plots is determined by the dates of postmarks on the completed applications. After the February 27 deadline, potential new members can send in applications to join the waiting list.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Many vegetables do well in the spring, and you will get good germination because of the moister soil. You can plant transplants or sow seed for <a href="http://www.seedsavers.org/apollo-arugula">arugula</a>, lettuce, members of the cabbage family (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and kale), <a href="http://www.johnnyseeds.com/p-6040-vit.aspx">mache</a>, spinach, carrots, beets, onions, or peas. There are also many kinds of <a href="http://www.johnnyseeds.com/c-358-asian.aspx">Asian greens</a> that grow quickly and like cool weather. Here's a <a href="/blog/zone-7-planting-calendar">Zone 7 planting calendar</a>.
</p>
<p>
<i><b>Monday May 30</b> is the day when your plot should be fully planted.</i>
</p>
<p>
If you have not fully planted your plot by this day then your plot will be given to someone on the waiting list. In the past some gardeners have put very little effort into their plots but this is no longer acceptable with such a high demand.
</p>
<p>
<i><b>May 31 - June 7</b>. Unplanted plots will be assigned to persons on waiting list.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>April 3 - November 6</b>. Planting, growing, and harvesting in the garden, donating extra produce to Plant A Row Project/Food Bank, participating in the Garden Contest, performing committee tasks, and having fun at the Garden.
</p>
<p>
<i><b>July 21</b> is the day of the Garden Contest.</i>
<p>
Winners receive ribbons! There's also an award for the best cluster of plots.
</p>
<p>
<i><b>October 20</b> is the potluck dinner.</i>
</p>
<p>
It's at 6:30, at the Nyack Senior Center, 90 Depew Avenue.
</p>

<i><b>Sunday November 6</b> is the day the Garden will close.</i> 
</p>
<p>
