## Garden Dates

***February 23** is the application deadline.*

New gardeners are encouraged to mail in completed applications as soon
as possible as priority on the waiting list for plots is determined by
the dates of postmarks on the completed applications. After the February
23 deadline, potential new members can send in applications to join the
waiting list.

***March 21 at 7:00 PM** is the General Garden Meeting.*

It's at the Nyack Senior Center, 90 Depew Avenue. Attendance is
required\!

***April 6 8:00 AM** is when the Garden gets staked.*

***April 7** is the day the Garden opens.*

Many vegetables do well in the spring, and you will get good germination
because of the moister soil. You can plant transplants or sow seed for
[arugula](http://www.seedsavers.org/apollo-arugula),
[lettuce](http://www.seedsavers.org/category/lettuce), members of the
cabbage family (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and kale),
[mache](http://www.johnnyseeds.com/p-6040-vit.aspx), spinach, carrots,
beets, onions, or peas. There are also many kinds of [Asian
greens](http://www.johnnyseeds.com/vegetables/greens/asian-greens/) that
grow quickly and like cool weather. Here's a [Zone 7 planting
calendar](/blog/zone-7-planting-calendar).

***May 31** is the day when your plot should be fully planted.*

If you have not fully planted your plot by this day then your plot will
be given to someone on the waiting list. In the past some gardeners have
put very little effort into their plots but this is no longer acceptable
with such a high demand.

***After May 31**. Unplanted plots will be assigned to persons on
waiting list.*

***TBD** is the day of the Garden Contest.*

Winners receive ribbons\!

***October 17** is the Potluck Dinner.*

It's at 6:30, at the Nyack Center, 58 Depew Avenue, corner of S.
Broadway

***November 3** is the day the Garden will close.*

All items most be removed and plots restored to state they had on April
7.

***November 9 8:00 AM** is the Garden cleanup day.*
