      <p><p>The garden will open on Sunday March 29.</p>

<p>Many vegetables do well in the spring. They will not grow as quickly as in the summer months but you should be able to get good germination because of the moister soil.</p>

<p>You can plant transplants or sow seed for <a href="http://www.kitchengardenseeds.com/cgi-bin/catview.cgi?_fn=Product&amp;_category=130" title="arugula">arugula</a>, lettuce, members of the cabbage family (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and kale), <a href="http://www.kitchengardenseeds.com/cgi-bin/catview.cgi?_fn=Product&amp;_category=203" title="mache">mache</a>, spinach, carrots, beets, onions, or peas. There are also many kinds of so-called <a href="http://www.johnnyseeds.com/c-358-asian.aspx">Asian greens</a> that do well in cooler weather.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a <a href="/blog/zone-7-planting-calendar/">Zone 7 planting calendar</a>.</p>

<p>This would also be a good time to plant a <a href="/blog/cover-crops/">cover crop</a> if you are so inclined.</p>

      <a href="//blog/our-garden-soil">Our garden soil</a>
      <p><p>One thing a gardener is going to be curious about is what&#39;s in their soil, particularly the urban gardener. I took soil samples from my plot and sent them off to the <a href="http://cnal.cals.cornell.edu/" title="Cornell Nutrient Analysis Lab">Cornell Nutrient Analysis Lab</a> for testing where they performed their #2020 test (Soil Acid Package or Soil Total Elemental Analysis). This test measures the levels of some acid-soluble elements in the soil, including various metals. Here&#39;s what they found, where the results are expressed in <em>mg/Kg</em>. These values are equivalent to <em>parts per million</em> (ppm).</p>

<p><img src="/images/Soil_Metal_Levels.png" alt="Soil\_Metal\_Levels.png"></p>

<p>Amongst the elements listed there you have lead (<em>Pb</em>), arsenic (<em>As</em>), and cadmium (<em>Cd</em>), all potentially toxic. Are our levels high? Here&#39;s a table that the lab supplied that shows some recommended maximum levels (our soil type is <em>silt to clay</em>):</p>

<p><img src="/images/Recommended_Maximum.png" alt="Recommended Maximum"></p>

<p>Bottom line, we&#39;re under the recommended maximum levels for arsenic, cadmium, copper, nickel, zinc, and arsenic, but slightly above what Cornell would like to see for lead (120 recommended, 146.42 actual). Is this a problem? You&#39;ll find different opinions on this online but here&#39;s a quote from <a href="http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/horticulture/DG2543.html">Lead in the Home Garden and Urban Soil Environment (University of Minnesota)</a>:</p>

<p><em>Since plants do not take up large quantities of soil lead, the lead levels in soil considered safe for plants will be much higher than soil lead levels where eating of soil is a concern. Generally, it has been considered safe to use garden produce grown in soils with total lead levels less than 300 ppm. The risk of lead poisoning through the food chain increases as the soil lead level rises above this concentration. Even at soil levels above 300 ppm, most of the risk is from lead contaminated soil or dust deposits on the plants rather than from uptake of lead by the plant.</em></p>

<p>Wash or peel your produce, never eat the soil itself, and there&#39;s no risk from this level of soil lead, that&#39;s my interpretation. </p>

<p>If you do more research on this remember these are the total or <em>acid-soluble</em> levels. Many of the elements in the soil, like iron (<em>Fe</em>) and aluminum (<em>Al</em>), are present in multiple forms or salts. Most of these forms are insoluble when the soil pH is neutral, 6 to 8, and these insoluble forms are not taken up by the plants and do not affect the plants (see <a href="/pdf/Behaviour_of_Metals_in_Soil.pdf">Behaviour of Metals in Soil</a> for some science on this).</p>

<p>See <a href="/blog/and-more-on-our-garden-soil/">More on our garden soil</a> for the test results on our soil&#39;s fertility.</p>

      <a href="//blog/and-more-on-our-garden-soil">And more on our garden soil</a>
      <p><p><img src="/images/1030_Test_Results.png" alt="1030\_Test\_Results.png"></p>

<p>The second test performed by <a href="http://cnal.cals.cornell.edu/" title="Cornell Nutrient Analysis Lab">Cornell Nutrient Analysis Lab</a> was their #1030 Soil Fertility Test. The results, above, are expressed in <em>mg/Kg</em>, equivalent to <em>parts per million</em> (ppm). The table below shows recommended ranges for some of these nutrients in farm or garden soil.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Soil_Nutrient_Ranges.png" alt="Soil\_Nutrient\_Ranges.png"></p>

<p>The <a href="/blog/our-garden-soil/">previous article on soil tests</a> mentioned some high total, metal levels, like those for iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al). But these metals only harm your plants if the soil is acid, which will dissolve the metals and make them available to the plants. You can see at the top that the soil&#39;s pH is 7.04, nearly neutral, neither acid nor alkaline. So we&#39;re in good shape there, the plants will do fine with the Fe and Al levels in our soil since most of the iron and aluminum is insoluble.</p>

<p>On the right you can see that the phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) levels in the soil are high, a bit above the optimum, in fact. This means that you do not need to fertilize in any way that will add P in particular, we&#39;ve got enough already.</p>

<p>We also have plenty of the trace, soluble, minerals magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and zinc (Zn). The only mineral that&#39;s on the low side is manganese (Mn) but even then it seems that you&#39;d only try to add manganese to your soil if it&#39;s less than 20 ppm and we have about 32. Remember that all living things need these minerals, they just don&#39;t want too much of them.</p>

<p>Then we come to loss on ignition (LOI) and organic matter (OM). The levels are very good, around 10%, well above what some would consider the minimum amount of organic matter, which is 2%. Mind you though, this soil is taken from a plot that gets covered with hay every year. I even take my weeds (and my neighbors&#39; weeds!) and layer them underneath the hay where they decompose quickly. There&#39;s a name for this, it&#39;s called <em>strip mulching</em>. Between the hay and the weeds I&#39;m adding a lot of organic matter to this soil, your plot probably is different if you&#39;re not adding organic matter to it.</p>

<p>Finally we get the soil nitrate level (NO3), about 14 ppm. One way agronomists talk about soil nitrate is to refer to specific plants and their nitrate requirements. For example, if you grow sweet corn you want plenty of nitrogen, at least 25 ppm of nitrate. So to grow the best possible corn you&#39;d find a way to add nitrogen to your plot, by adding manure or blood meal, or by growing a cover crop and tilling it in. Tomatoes, peppers, and squash are similar in their nitrate needs, ideally they get nitrate in the range of 25 to 50 ppm. Of course these plants grow and make great vegetables with less than 25 ppm nitrate but if you want the best possible outcome you&#39;d add nitrogen in some form.</p>

<p>If you do add some form of nitrogen follow the instructions carefully! Over-fertilizing with N will give you big plants with lots of foliage and not much else. Great for cabbage, not so good for tomatoes.</p>

      <a href="//blog/what-tomato-disease-is-it">What Tomato Disease is this?</a>
      <p><p>A tomato disease hit our garden hard starting in the damp month of August. You&#39;d hear talk of &quot;blight&quot; if you conversed with other gardeners but is it really the same disease that killed our tomatoes in July of 2009? That disease struck farms and gardens throughout New York and was <em>Phytophthora infestans,</em> or late blight, the same fungus that was responsible for the Irish potato famine. This disease is clearly not the same. For one it does not affect the fruit, whereas blight does. In addition its lesions have a different shape and color from late blight symptons (see <a href="http://organicgardening.about.com/b/2009/07/05/diagnosing-tomato-diseases-is-it-early-blight-late-blight-or-septoria.htm">tomato blight</a> for pictures). Finally farmers and gardeners and scientists are not talking about blight this year in Rockland county, and it&#39;s unlikely that there would be a late blight infestation that&#39;s only affecting our garden given how devastating the blight was to all the local farms in 2009.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at various Web sites and concluded that it&#39;s likely to be <a href="http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/publications/tomatoproblemsolver/leaf/gray_spot.html">Gray Leaf Spot</a>, or Stemphylium. It could also be <a href="http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Tomato_Septoria.htm">Septoria Leaf Spot</a>. I&#39;m thinking this because of the affected tissues, leaves only (not fruit), and the appearance of the lesions. Take a look at the pictures below, these show how the disease progresses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Small, dry brown or gray-brown spots appear first on the <strong>underside of the leaves</strong></li>
<li>Dry yellow or brown spots appear on the top of the leaves once the infection is established underneath</li>
<li>Sections of the leaf turn brown and die</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/DSCN8049_large_450x337.jpg" alt="Diseased leaf 1">
<img src="/images/DSCN8053_large_450x337.jpg" alt="Diseased leaf 2">
<img src="/images/DSCN8059_large_450x337.jpg" alt="Diseased leaf 3"><br>

<img src="/images/DSCN8068_large_450x337.jpg" alt="Diseased leaf 8"></p>

<p>Here&#39;s some common-sense advice:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Keep your tomatoes dry by watering them at ground level since the fungus flourishes on wet leaves</li>
<li>  The disease starts at the bottom of the plant so check the undersides of those lower leaves</li>
<li>  Remove any leaf that has the characteristic gray or brown spots</li>

      <p><p>Don&#39;t be the gardener who is cursing in July while hoeing overgrown weeds in the blazing sun. There is an easier way, it&#39;s mulch. When you mulch you weed much less, you water less, and your soil is moister in mid-summer. Trust us, you want to mulch and your plants will thank you too</p>

<p>Many gardeners in this garden use plastic mulch, which comes in sheets that you roll out and pin down with metal or plastic pegs. The problem with plastic sheets is that it does not decompose, so your soil gets no benefit. Then you&#39;ve got the plastic waste itself every year, that&#39;s not good.</p>

<p>A 21st century black mulch which also comes in sheets is <a href="http://www.johnnyseeds.com/p-6978-biotelo-biodegradable-mulch-4-5-x-32.aspx">BioTelo Biodegradable Mulch</a>. The material is made from corn and decomposes over the season and then you end up with improved soil over time, if you till the mulch in. You could also lay straw on top of this but this is probably not necessary.</p>

<p>You want to put the BioTelo down early in the season, for 2 reasons. One, this prevents the weeds from growing. Less weeding is always good. Two, your soil is going to heat up faster with this mulch in place, which the heat-loving plants like tomatoes and peppers are going to like.</p>

<p>You can get <a href="http://www.johnnyseeds.com/p-6978-biotelo-biodegradable-mulch-4-5-x-32.aspx" title="paper mulch">BioTelo Biodegradable Mulch from Johnny&#39;s Seeds</a>. For my full plot I use 2 rolls. I also use a bale of straw where I don&#39;t put down BioTelo, this lasts the entire season.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that straw is an insulator so if you lay it down on cool soil that soil is going to heat up more slowly.</p>

<p>You can get straw at:</p>

</ul>

<p>Home Depot and Lowe&#39;s also have straw, or hay.</p>
