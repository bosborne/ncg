<h2>About the Garden</h2>
<p>
The Nyack Community Garden is a community based, nonprofit organization that provides residents of the Nyack School District with an opportunity to grow vegetables and flowers in a safe, friendly environment. Using land provided by the Robert Martin Company in downtown Nyack, the garden donates surplus vegetables to local charities and enhances the beauty of the community.

The Nyack Community Garden is a space on <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?minlon=-73.9218139648438&minlat=41.0889358520508&maxlon=-73.9215545654297&maxlat=41.0897102355957">South Franklin Street between Depew and Hudson Avenues</a> in Nyack for community residents to garden together – to work individually and collaboratively. The garden’s members plant vegetables, fruits, and flowers in their individual plots and assist in the management and maintenance of the whole garden including surrounding flower beds. They produce nutritious food and beautiful flowers for their own use. Many donate to local food banks through the NCG’s “Plant a Row Project/Food Bank” committee.

A full plot is 180 square feet, and costs $35 for a season. Newcomers get half plots which are half that size, and cost $25.

Founded in 1983, the garden has evolved into a wonderful community asset with lovely gardens, a paved center path, a sturdy tool shed housing tools shared by gardeners, easily accessible watering hoses, high protective fencing, and rich soil. The volunteer-managed garden has over 60 members gardening in half and full plots. Its membership is open to residents of the Nyack School District who are 18 years or older. The gardeners are a community where everyone pitches in to overcome problems, help their neighbors, and share gardening tips. Every July a garden contest is held, judged by locals.

At the Nyack Community Garden each plot is a unique environment displaying the diversity of the NCG membership. Visitors to Nyack enjoy strolling by the garden experiencing its diverse colors and fragrances, viewing its horticultural variety, and chatting with industrious gardeners.

The vital support of the Robert Martin Company, in concert with the Community Housing Management Corporation, is greatly appreciated.
