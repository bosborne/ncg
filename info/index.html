<h2>About the Garden</h2>
<p>
The Nyack Community Garden is a community based, nonprofit organization that provides residents of the Nyack School District with an opportunity to grow vegetables and flowers in a safe, friendly environment. Using land provided by the <a href="http://robertmartincompany.com">Robert Martin Company</a> in downtown Nyack, the garden donates surplus vegetables to local charities and enhances the beauty of the community.

The Nyack Community Garden is a space on <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?minlon=-73.9218139648438&minlat=41.0889358520508&maxlon=-73.9215545654297&maxlat=41.0897102355957">South Franklin Street between Depew and Hudson Avenues</a> in Nyack for community residents to garden together – to work individually and collaboratively. The garden’s members plant vegetables, fruits, and flowers in their individual plots and assist in the management and maintenance of the whole garden including surrounding flower beds. They produce nutritious food and beautiful flowers for their own use. Many donate to local food banks through the NCG’s "Plant a Row for the Hungry" committee.

<p>
Founded in the mid 1970's (see <a href="/pdf/Newsletter_Oct_Nov_2018.pdf">an article about our garden's history</a>), the garden has evolved into a wonderful community asset with lovely gardens, a paved center path, a sturdy tool shed housing tools shared by gardeners, easily accessible watering hoses, high protective fencing, and rich soil. The volunteer-managed garden has over 80 members gardening in half and full plots. Its membership is open to residents of the Nyack School District who are 18 years or older. The gardeners are a community where everyone pitches in to overcome problems, help their neighbors, and share gardening tips. Every July a garden contest is held, judged by locals.

<p>
Gardeners must reside in the Nyack School District.  Subject to availability, new gardeners are eligible for ½ plots which are approximately 90 square feet.  A full plot is 180 square feet, and costs $35 for a season. Newcomers get plots which are half that size, and cost $25.  All gardeners must obey the rules and regulations, assist with the running and care of the garden, and must serve on a garden committee and provide at least 6 hours to the care of the entire garden.  For persons who were not members of the Nyack Community Garden during the previous year, the priority for plots and for placement on the waiting list is determined by postmark date of the application materials.  Plot availability for new gardeners is limited.  Eligible persons who send in applications who do not receive plots are put on our waiting list.  Typically several people on the waiting list are awarded plots after May 31st due to plots being vacated.

At the Nyack Community Garden each plot is a unique environment displaying the diversity of the NCG membership. Visitors to Nyack enjoy strolling by the garden experiencing its diverse colors and fragrances, viewing its horticultural variety, and chatting with industrious gardeners.
